# Lab: Build your first declarative copilot
# Student lab answer key

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Get your data ready

1.  First, clearly define the purpose and scope of your Declarative Copilot. In this case, the Copilot will assist hiring managers in creating and managing new employee training paths.
1.  Collect all relevant training materials, including onboarding documents, training modules, and company policies. Organize this information in a structured format, such as a SharePoint site or an internal knowledge base. Ensure that the information is up-to-date and easily accessible.
1.  Set up a knowledge base where the Copilot can access the training materials. This can be done using SharePoint, OneDrive, or any other document management system. Ensure that the knowledge base is well-organized and searchable.

### Exercise 2: 

#### Task 1: Developt the Copilot's Logic and Responses

1. Using a combination of Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents, develop the logic and responses for the Copilot.
  1. **Power Automate** - Create automated workflows to handle tasks such as assigning training modules, sending notifications, and tracking progress. For example, you can create a flow that triggers when a new employee is added to the system, assigns the relevant training modules, and sends a notification to the hiring manager.
  1. **Power Virtual Agents** - Build a chatbot using Power Virtual Agents to handle queries from hiring managers and guide them through the process of creating training paths. Define the topics and triggers for the chatbot, and create the conversation flows to provide accurate and helpful responses.

#### Task 2: Integrate with Microsoft Teams

1. Integrate the Copilot with Microsoft Teams to make it easily accessible to hiring managers. You can add the Power Virtual Agents chatbot to a Teams channel or create a custom Teams app that includes the Copilot's functionalities.

#### Task 3: Test, refine, deploy and monitor the Copilot

1. Test the Copilot with a small group of hiring managers to ensure it works as expected. Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to improve the Copilot's performance and user experience.
1.  Once you are satisfied with the Copilot's performance, deploy it to all hiring managers. Continuously monitor its usage and gather feedback to make ongoing improvements and optimizations.
