# Lab: Building an agent using Graph connectors
# Student lab answer key

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Setup the Graph connector

1.  Log in to the Microsoft 365 Admin center with your admin credentials.
1.  Go to the **Settings** menu and select **Search & intelligence** then **Connectors.**
1.  Select **Add a connector** and choose the appropriate connector for your data source (e.g., CRM system, knowledge base, email system).
1.  Follow the prompts to configure the connector. This includes providing the necessary credentials, specifying the data source, and setting up the connection parameters.
1.  Once configured, test the connection to ensure that the data is being pulled correctly from the source.

### Exercise 1: 

#### Task 1: Index the data

1. Specify the schema for the data being indexed. This includes defining the fields and their data types.
1. Map the fields from your data source to the schema defined in the previous step.
1. Configure the crawling schedule to determine how often the data should be indexed. You can set it to run at specific intervals or on-demand.
1. Monitor the indexing process to ensure that the data is being indexed correctly. You can view the status and logs in the Admin Center.

#### Task 2: Integrate with Microsoft 365

1.  Once the data has been indexed, enable the connector to make the dtaa available in Microsoft 365.
1. Set up the necessary permissions to control who can access the indexed data. This includes configuring access controls and security settings.
1. Test the integration by performing searches in Microsoft 365 to ensure that the data from the connector is being retrieved correctly.

#### Task 3: Use the data in Copilot

1. Train the Copilot to use the indexed data by providing relevant queries and responses.
1. Deploy the Copilot to your customer support team. Ensure the Copilot is integrated with the tools and platforms used by the support team.
1. Continue to monitor the performance and optimize it based on feedback and usage data.
